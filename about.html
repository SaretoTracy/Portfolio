                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, I am Tracy Chepkorir, based in Nairobi, Kenya. With 2 years of experience, I'm currently a front end developer and UI designer.<br> HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, and React are among my skills.A Construction onestop shop is one
                    of the projects I'm most proud of.<br> We created a fantastic website that allows local contractors to find construction materials suppliers in one place and choose who they want to deal with. <br> It was a lot of fun figuring out
                    how to properly program the responsive section. I was fortunate to be part of an incredible team, <br> and I truly believe I improved my talents as a result of the challenge.</p>
