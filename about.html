                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, I am Tracy Chepkorir, based in Nairobi, Kenya. With 2 years of experience, I'm currently
                    <br> a front end developer and UI designer.HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, and React are among my skills.<br> A Construction onestop shop is one of the projects I'm most proud of.We created a fantastic <br> website that allows local
                    contractors to find construction materials suppliers in one place<br> and choose who they want to deal with. It was a lot of fun figuring out how to properly<br> program the responsive section. I was fortunate to be part of an incredible
                    team, and I truly <br> believe I improved my talents as a result of the challenge.</p>
